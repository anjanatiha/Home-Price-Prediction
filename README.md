In this question, you will experiment with Lasso and Ridge regression.
1. Performed Lasso and Ridge Regression using Boston housing prices dataset and compared the performance by tuning the parameters and not tuning the parameters using cross validation.
2. Tune the parameter alpha (regularization strength) for Ridge and Lasso using the validation set. 
3. Report the Mean Squared Error on the test set using the tuned parameters.
4. Compare this result with the results you get without tuning the parameters.
